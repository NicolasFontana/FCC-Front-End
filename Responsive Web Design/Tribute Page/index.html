        <p id="tribute-info" class="description">In this article we want to offer you a complete list of Marvel movies and series ordered chronologically. It must be made clear that they are not ordered according to their release date, but by the chronology of the joint history in which the Cinematic Universe takes place. For this, you will be able to discover the different Marvel movies and series with the synopses that they offer us from the Filmaffinity portal.

        <p class="description">
It should be noted that there are some Marvel movies and series that are canon within the UCM. However, it is not clear to us when to place them within this chronology. We are talking about productions such as the Spider-Man movies by Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield as well as television series such as Daredevil. Similarly, with the exception of Tom Holland's Spider-Man films, we have decided to leave out the Sony films (Venom: There Will Be Carnage, Morbius, etcâ€¦) as, objectively, to date they have no real impact within from the MCU. With that said, let's start with the Marvel timeline.
